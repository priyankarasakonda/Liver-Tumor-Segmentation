# Liver Tumor Segmentation
 Detecting the tumor in Liver
Liver Tumor is the primary cancer-related cause of mortality worldwide. Computed tomography (CT)-assisted early detection of the liver tumor could spare the lives of millions of people each year. Radiologists must read hundreds or even tens of these CT scans, which is a tremendous load. Therefore, there is a pressing need for automated, rapid, and accurate CT scan reading, detection, and evaluation. However, any system's bottleneck is liver segmentation and extraction from CT scans, which is still a difficult problem. In this study, a deep learning-based method for semantic pixel-by-pixel classification of road scenes is adopted and adjusted to match liver CT segmentation and classification. U-Net is the name of the deep convolutional encoder-architecture, decoders which comprise layers of encoders and decoders arranged in a hierarchy. The suggested architecture demonstrated tumor accuracy of up to 99.9% during the training phase when tested on a standard dataset for liver CT scans.
